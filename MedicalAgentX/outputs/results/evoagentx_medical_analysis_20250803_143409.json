There is a trend in the directions of the pointestimates towards a beneﬁcial proﬁle, which impor-tantly is in line with many other studies clearly\ndemonstrating a beneﬁcial eﬀect of anticoagulation in\npatients with atrial ﬁbrillation but no dementia [38].\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n案例 3 (相似度: 1.0000)\n来源: ene.14412.pdf\n内容: ohort study was iden-\ntiﬁed which reported on dementia patients with allthree vascular risk factors [41] (Figure S2 andTables S3 and S7). Twenty patients were followed fora mean (SD) of 30 (6) months. Treatment of one ormore vascular risk factors was associated with lessdecline on Mini Mental State Examination [mean dif-ference 2 (95 % CI /C03.1 to 7.2)] compared to no\ntreatment at all (Table S8). The study did not report\ndata on the three remaining outcomes. No grading ofevidence, using the GRADE framework, was carriedout since it was the opinion of the authors that theevidence was insuﬃcient to make a recommendation.Financial disclosures and a statement on conﬂict ofinterest were reported for the study (Table S1).\nLevel of evidence\nNot applicable.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n案例 4 (相似度: 1.0000)\n来源: ene.14412.pdf\n内容: ognitive impairment, impaired gait, seda-tion, tremor, dizziness, visual disturbances and mood),to which older people are sensitive, and which may beparticularly troublesome in patients with dementia. Ifvalproate is considered, it is important to be aware ofthe risk of valproate encephalopathy (lethargy,reduced attention, behavioral changes) [98].\nDiscussion\nThis Guideline summarizes the evidence for the man-agement of important medical issues in patients withdementia and gives recommendations for clinicians.One of the striking ﬁndings of the Guideline is the rela-tive paucity of evidence for the medical management of\nmedical issues in dementia, a chronic disorder with seri-\nous impact on patients, caregivers and society. Accessto specialists is often limited in this patient population,and clinicians are faced with these management issueson a regular basis.

We found one studythat was eligible for inclusion [36]. In a retrospectivecohort study in patients with dementia and atrial ﬁb-rillation (but no previous stroke), results from 3724patients followed for a median (interquartile range) of\n669 (805) days, were reported. Patients were either\nnot treated (for unknown reasons) or treated withwarfarin. Treatment was not associated with anincreased risk of major hemorrhagic events [hazardratio 1.07, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 0.82 –1.39], adecreased risk of mortality (hazard ratio 0.88, 95% CI\n0.77–1.01) and ischemic stroke (hazard ratio 0.74,\n95% CI 0.54 –1.03). The study did not report on glo-\nbal cognitive function (Tables S4 and S5). A ﬁnancialdisclosure statement and a conﬂict of interest state-ment were reported for the study (Table S1).\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n",
