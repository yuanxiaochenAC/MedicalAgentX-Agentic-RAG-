Psychotropic treatment (Important); 2.\nGlobal cognitive function (Important); 3. Agitation/\naggression (Critical); 4. Neuropsychiatric symptoms\n(Important).\nSummary of evidence\nAfter screening, we included a single RCT [49] (Fig-ure S3 and Table S9). In a placebo-controlled crossoverstudy, 25 patients were randomized to either paraceta-mol or placebo. There was no diﬀerence in change in agi-\ntation over 8 weeks (as measured by the Cohen-\nMansﬁeld Agitation inventory).\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n案例 5 (相似度: 1.0000)\n来源: ene.14412.pdf\n内容: nitive decline and dementia [26] and with\nthe rate of progression of dementia and the occur-rence of brain pathology such as small vessel disease[27,28], lacunar infarcts [29,30] and microbleeds [31].Hence, optimal management of vascular risk factorsmay potentially modify the disease course in demen-tia. On the other hand, pharmacological treatment ofvascular risk factors is associated with unwanted side\neﬀects such as an increased risk of intracerebral hem-\norrhage with anticoagulants [32] and dizziness andfalls with anti-hypertensives. However, diﬀerentiatingtreatment based on cognitive status and the aforemen-tioned side eﬀects may not be warranted. It is likelythat in many patients with dementia, vascular condi-tions and risk factors are identiﬁed at the time of thedementia diagnosis. Usually medical doctors would\ntreat such conditions.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n",
